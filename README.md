# Diskuss_Forum
This is a programming forum discussion website named DISKUSS.

This website is created with HTML, CSS , Bootstrap in the front-end and PHP is used in the back-end. I have used PHPMyAdmin as a database and MYSQL as query language.

*Instructions for running the website
  -Install XAMPP.
  -Now copy the whole forum file and open the xampp folder in your computer.
  -Paste the folder inside the htdocs folder of Xampp.
  -Now open up a browserand write http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php? in the address bar.
  -Now on the left side click on new, it is for generating a new database and name it diskuss.
  -Now click on New inside Diskuss to generate new table, after this make 5 tables named categories, comments, contact _form,threads,users.
  -Now inside categories, make 4 columns, named, category_id,category_name,category_description nad created.
  -Inside the comments, write comment_id,comment_content,thread_id,commented_by,comment_time.
  -Inside contact_form write,sno,email,concern,time.
  -Inside threads write thread_id,thread_title,thread_descr,thread_cat_id,thread_user_id,timestamp.
  -Inside users write, sno,user_email,user_pass,timestamp.
  -Now run Xampp and a xamp control panel will appear, start the first two options(under Actions) which are Apache and mysql.
  -Now open chrome with a new tab and write :"localhost/forum".
  
VOILA! the site is up and running.
