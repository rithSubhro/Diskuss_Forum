This is a programming forum discussion website.
A PROGRAMMING DISCUSSION FORUM WEBSITE

This website is created with HTML, CSS , Bootstrap in the front-end and PHP is used in the back-end. I have used PHPMyAdmin as a database and MYSQL as query language.

*Instructions for running the website
  -Install XAMPP.
  -Now copy the whole forum file and open the xampp folder in your computer.
  -Paste the folder inside the htdocs folder of Xampp.
  -Now run Xampp and a xamp control panel will appear, start the first two options(under Actions) which are Apache and mysql.
  -Now open chrome with a new tab and write :"localhost/forum".
  
VOILA! the site is up and running.
